A Small World

## TODO
- Fish with different colors
	- Primary: Red, Green, Blue
	- Secondary: Yellow, Turquoise, Pink
- Breeding:
	- Red + Green -> Yellow
	- Green + Blue -> Turquoise
	- Blue + Red -> Pink
	- Yellow + Pink -> Red
	- Pink + Turquoise -> Blue
	- Turquoise + Yellow -> Green
	- Secondary Colors + Main = Random Result (50/50)
- Sale: Primary Color + Random Color (bonus money)
- Buy:
	- Fish
		- Always more expensive than selling - even random ones
		- Primary Colors
		- Clam (bonus money for no effort, but more sensitive to pollution)
	- Plants
		- Moss (cheap, 2 poop)
		- Treething (more expensive, 10 poop)
		- Cleaning Tablet (expensive, disappears, cleans a shitload)
- Buy lets you drop the thing at a selectable x-position (above fish tank)


##Ideas
- Fish Tank "Management" Game **WINNER**
	- Feed/Grow/Sell fish/plants
- Game with Toys/Toy sized things
- ... *I am bad at coming up with stuff, alright?*
